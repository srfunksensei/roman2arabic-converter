# Roman2Arabic converter

The Roman Numeration was developed in Ancient Rome and used for a long time, as the main form of numerical representation in Europe. 
Unlike Arabic numerals, where each digit has a certain value, depending on its position, in Roman numerals the symbols used always have the same value, regardless of their position.

This simple program converts Roman to Arabic numerals.
